Welcome to the Dice Game! This game is designed to test your luck and strategy. The game's objective is to score 100 points before your opponent does.

We've utilized JavaScript to create the logic for this game. This involved understanding the concepts of event handling and manipulating the HTML and CSS to provide a seamless gaming experience.

In this game, each player takes turns rolling a dice. The number on the dice represents the player's score for that turn. The player can choose to "hold" their score and pass control to the other player, or they can choose to continue playing and accumulate more points. However, if the player rolls a "0" their current score will reset to zero, and control will be passed to the other player.

The game is won when a player scores 100 points before their opponent. If you press the "hold" button, your current score will be stored, and control will be passed to the other player. If you choose not to hold and continue playing, and roll a "0" the entire score that has not been stored will be turned to zero. To reset the game, simply press the reset button.

We hope you enjoy playing this game and challenging your luck and strategy skills!
